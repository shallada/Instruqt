    Our Druid deployment will use four servers.
    ![Druid Server Architecture](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/shallada/InstruqtImages/main/druid-architecture/servers.png)

    We need to install the Druid software and configure it on each of the servers.
    In this challenge, we'll deploy the master server and lay the foundation for the other servers.

    <details>
      <summary style="color:cyan">What are the tabs we'll use in this track? Click here to find out.</b></summary>
    <hr style="background-color:cyan">
    We will deploy Druid using four servers.
    In each challenge, as we set up another server, we will add another tab which will give you Bash shell access to the server.
    <br>
    <br>
    Besides the Bash shell tabs, there is one additional tab, which is an editor tab on the master server.
    We will use this editor to edit files on the master server and then copy them as needed to the other servers.
    <hr style="background-color:cyan">
    </details>


    Start by downloading the Druid distribution.

    ```
    wget https://ftp.wayne.edu/apache/druid/0.21.1/apache-druid-0.21.1-bin.tar.gz
    ```

    Unzip the downloaded file and move into the resulting directory.

    ```
    tar -xzf apache-druid-0.21.1-bin.tar.gz
    cd apache-druid-0.21.1
    ```

    Druid uses deep storage - normally something like S3.
    For this example, we'll use MinIO to simulate S3 storage.


    Download and start the MinIO server.

    ```
    wget https://dl.min.io/server/minio/release/linux-amd64/minio
    export MINIO_ROOT_USER=admin
    export MINIO_ROOT_PASSWORD=password
    export MINIO_BROWSER_REDIRECT_URL="https://master-server-9001-$INSTRUQT_PARTICIPANT_ID.env.play.instruqt.com"

    chmod +x minio
    nohup /root/apache-druid-0.21.1/minio server --console-address :9001 /root/data > /root/minio-log.out 2> /root/minio-log.err < /dev/null & disown
    ```

    We'll use the MinIO Client (mc) to interact with MinIO.

    Download the MinIO client and use it to create a bucket named _druid_.

    ```
    wget https://dl.min.io/client/mc/release/linux-amd64/mc
    chmod +x mc
    ./mc mb druid

    ```

    The S3 extension uses Jets3t, so we need to create a properties file for this utility.

    ```
    cat > /root/apache-druid-0.21.1/conf/druid/cluster/_common/jets3t.properties << EOF
    s3service.s3-endpoint=master-server
    s3service.s3-endpoint-http-port=9000
    s3service.disable-dns-buckets=true
    s3service.https-only=false
    EOF
    ```

    In this challenge, we will be working with servers that are smaller than you would normally use in production.
    For educational purposes, these smaller servers will suffice.


    But to deploy on these smaller servers, we need to restrict the amount of memory the various processes use.
    To do this, we will use the same configuration files we used in the single server quickstart example.


    Let's review the changes that we will cause by using the quickstart configuration.

    ```
    diff /root/apache-druid-0.21.1/conf/druid/single-server/nano-quickstart/coordinator-overlord/jvm.config conf/druid/cluster/master/coordinator-overlord/jvm.config
    ```

    These changes show Java command options that will decrease the memory consumption.


    Now, let's copy this configuration file into our cluster configuration.

    ```
    cp conf/druid/single-server/nano-quickstart/coordinator-overlord/jvm.config conf/druid/cluster/master/coordinator-overlord
    ```

    We need to configure the servers so that they can discover each other.

    <hr style="background-color:cyan">
    <ol>
    <li>On each server, in the common configuration file, we set <i>druid.zk.service.host</i> to tell the server how to contact ZooKeeper</li>

    </details>

    Click on the _Master-editor_ tab in the top-left corner of this screen.

    ![Click Master-editor tab](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/shallada/InstruqtImages/main/druid-architecture/ClickMasterEditor.png)

    Open the file: <i>/root/apache-druid-0.21.1/conf/druid/cluster/_common/common.runtime.properties</i>.

    ![Common Proper File Path](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/shallada/InstruqtImages/main/druid-architecture/CommonFilePath.png)

    Search for line _druid.host=localhost_ and comment the line out.

    Next, search for _druid.zk.service.host_ and change its value (which is currently _localhost_) to
    ```
    master-server:2181
    ```

    ![Change Values](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/shallada/InstruqtImages/main/druid-architecture/ChangeValuesMaster.png)


    ## BEGIN the S3 section


    We also need to configure Druid to use MinIO.
    Search for the line that starts with _druid.extensions.loadList_ and replace it with the following (which adds _druid-s3-extensions_).

    ```
    druid.extensions.loadList=["druid-hdfs-storage", "druid-kafka-indexing-service", "druid-datasketches", "druid-s3-extensions"]
    ```

    In the _Deep storage_ section of the properties file, comment out the section related to local disk.

    Also in the _Deep storage_ section, replace the S3 sub-section with the following.

    ```
    # For S3:
    druid.storage.type=s3
    druid.storage.bucket=druid
    druid.storage.baseKey=segments
    druid.s3.accessKey=admin
    druid.s3.secretKey=password
    druid.s3.protocol=http
    druid.s3.enablePathStyleAccess=true
    druid.s3.endpoint.signingRegion=us-east-1
    druid.s3.endpoint.url=master-server:9000/
    ```

    We want to store the service logs on S3 as well.
    So, in the _Indexing service logs_ section, comment out the _local disk_ configuration.

    Also within the _Indexing service logs_ section, replace the S3 sub-section with the following.

    ```
    # For S3:
    druid.indexer.logs.type=s3
    druid.indexer.logs.s3Bucket=druid
    druid.indexer.logs.s3Prefix=druid/indexing-logs
    ```

    ## END the S3 section

    Save the file by clicking on the save icon in the tab.

    ![Save File Changes](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/shallada/InstruqtImages/main/druid-architecture/SaveFileChanges.png)

    <hr style="background-color:cyan">
    <p><span style="color:cyan"><strong><em>NOTE:</em></strong></span> <i>Be sure to save the file.
    Modified files show a blue dot in the editor tab, so if you see the blue dot, you still need to save the file.</i>
    <hr style="background-color:cyan">


    Return the the Master-shell tab.

    ![Click Master-shell tab](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/shallada/InstruqtImages/main/druid-architecture/ClickMasterShell.png)


    Now, we can launch the master server.
    We will use _nohup_ here so that the process doesn't die when we move to the next challenge.

    ```
    nohup /root/apache-druid-0.21.1/bin/start-cluster-master-with-zk-server > /root/apache-druid-0.21.1/log.out 2> /root/apache-druid-0.21.1/log.err < /dev/null & disown
    ```

    Check that ZooKeeper and the coordinator processes are running (you should see two Java processes near the bottom of the list of processes).

    ```
    ps -ef
    ```

    You can find the log files for these processes here:

    ```
    tail var/sv/coordinator-overlord.log
    ```

    and here:

    ```
    tail var/sv/zk.log

  assignment: |-
    In this challenge we will deploy the first of two data servers named _data-server-1_.


    Download the Druid distibution.

    ```
    wget https://ftp.wayne.edu/apache/druid/0.21.1/apache-druid-0.21.1-bin.tar.gz

    ```

    Unzip the downloaded file and move into the resulting directory.

    ```
    tar -xzf apache-druid-0.21.1-bin.tar.gz
    cd apache-druid-0.21.1

    ```

    Again, we will be working with servers that are smaller than you would use in production.
    We need to restrict the amount of memory the various processes use.
    So, to cut back on memory usage, we will use the same configuration files we used in the single server quickstart example.


    Here are the commands you can use to see what changes we will be making to four different files.

    ```
    diff /root/apache-druid-0.21.1/conf/druid/single-server/nano-quickstart/historical/runtime.properties conf/druid/cluster/data/historical/runtime.properties
    ```


    ```
    diff /root/apache-druid-0.21.1/conf/druid/single-server/nano-quickstart/historical/jvm.config conf/druid/cluster/data/historical/jvm.config
    ```


    ```
    diff /root/apache-druid-0.21.1/conf/druid/single-server/nano-quickstart/middleManager/runtime.properties conf/druid/cluster/data/middleManager/runtime.properties
    ```


    ```
    diff /root/apache-druid-0.21.1/conf/druid/single-server/nano-quickstart/middleManager/jvm.config conf/druid/cluster/data/middleManager/jvm.config
    ```


    Let's copy these files into our cluster configuration.

    ```
    cp conf/druid/single-server/nano-quickstart/historical/* conf/druid/cluster/data/historical
    cp conf/druid/single-server/nano-quickstart/middleManager/* conf/druid/cluster/data/middleManager
    ```

    Now, let's copy the _common.runtime.properties_ file we edited in the first challenge to this server.
    Remember, this file tells the server how to contact ZooKeeper.

    ```
    scp -o StrictHostKeyChecking=no master-server:/root/apache-druid-0.21.1/conf/druid/cluster/_common/common.runtime.properties /root/apache-druid-0.21.1/conf/druid/cluster/_common/common.runtime.properties
    ```

    We are set to launch the first data server.
    Again, we'll use _nohup_ so that the processes continue to run when we move to the next challenge.

    ```
    nohup /root/apache-druid-0.21.1/bin/start-cluster-data-server > /root/apache-druid-0.21.1/log.out 2> /root/apache-druid-0.21.1/log.err < /dev/null & disown
    ```


    Check that the historical and middleManager processes are running.

    ```
    ps -ef | grep "java\-[8-8]" | awk 'NF{print $NF}'
    ```

    You can find the log files for these processes here:

    ```
    tail var/sv/historical.log
    ```

    and here:

    ```
    tail var/sv/middleManager.log

    In this challenge we will deploy the second of two data servers named _data-server-2_.
    This server works just like data-server-1.


    Download the Druid distibution.

    ```
    wget https://ftp.wayne.edu/apache/druid/0.21.1/apache-druid-0.21.1-bin.tar.gz

    ```
    tar -xzf apache-druid-0.21.1-bin.tar.gz
    cd apache-druid-0.21.1
    ```

    Let's copy the files to change the configuration like we did with data-server-1.

    ```
    cp conf/druid/single-server/nano-quickstart/historical/* conf/druid/cluster/data/historical
    cp conf/druid/single-server/nano-quickstart/middleManager/* conf/druid/cluster/data/middleManager
